                pulling your miles away and outter reach
                from me but you're here in my heart so
                who can stop me a fight aside that

                mountains and there are doors that we
                can't walk through I know you're
                wondering why because we're able to be
                just you and me Within These Walls but
                when we go inside you're going to wake
                up and see that it was hopeless after
