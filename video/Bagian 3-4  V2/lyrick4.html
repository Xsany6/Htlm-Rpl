            <h2>Lagu Cover Shani-Yan: Enchanted - Taylor Swift</h2>
            <hr>
            <pre>
        I walked through the door with you
        The air was cold, but something 'bout it felt like home somehow
        Left my scarf there at your sister's house
        And you still got it in your drawer, even now
        Oh, your sweet disposition, and my wide eyed gaze
        We're singing in a car getting lost upstate

        Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
        And I can picture it after all these days
        And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
        And I might be okay, but I'm not, fine at all
        Cause here we are again on that little town street
        You almost ran the red cause you were looking over to me
        Wind in my hair, I was there,
        <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more" class="more-content">
        I remember it all too well
        Photo album on my counter, your cheeks were turning red
        You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin size bed
        And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on a tee-ball team
        You tell me 'bout your past thinking your future was me
        Cause here we are again in the middle of the night
        We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
        Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well

        And maybe we got lost in translation
        Maybe I asked for too much
        But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
        Till you tore it all up
        Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
        And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
        So casually cruel in the name of being honest

        I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
        Cause I remember it all, all, all too well

        Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
        I'd like to be my old self again
        But I'm still trying to find it
        After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
        Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
        But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
        Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
        You can't get rid of it, cause you remember it all too well, yeah
        Cause there we are again when I loved you so

        Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
        It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
        Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
        Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
        It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
        </span>
